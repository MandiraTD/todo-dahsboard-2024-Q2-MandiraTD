### Todo Dashboard Project

Sure, here are the instructions for setting up and running your project after it has been uploaded to GitHub:

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
 
     git clone <repository_url>
  

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Change your current directory to the project directory using the `cd` command:
 
     cd <project_directory>

   - Replace `<project_directory>` with the name of your project directory.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
 
   - Run the following command to install dependencies using npm (Node.js package manager):
   
     npm install
 
   - This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### Running the Project:

Once you've set up the project, you can run it using the following steps:

1. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Because this project is a web application, you may need to start a development server.
   - Run the following command to start the development server:
   
     npm start
 
   - This command will start the development server and typically open the project in your default web browser.

2. **Access the Project**:
   - Once the development server is running, you can access the project by opening a web browser and navigating to the specified URL. This URL is usually displayed in the terminal where you started the development server.

3. **View and Interact with the Project**:
   - Once the project is loaded in your web browser, you can view and interact with it as needed.
